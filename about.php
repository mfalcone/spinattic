	        		<h2>Our Story</h2>
	        		<p>Spinattic was born out of the culmination of 2 companies built on manually designing and programming custom virtual tours. Virtual Media 360 and Ciudad Esferica together created an estimated 100 custom virtual tours for various clients and panoramic photographers in the virtual reality industry. We quickly found ourselves only serving clients with bigger budgets that would be able to pay for the long laborious hours designing and programming the tour's interfaces. Both Virtual Media 360 and Ciudad Esferica wants, and still does to this day maintain a high standard of excellence in their virtual tours. Higher quality is synonymous with longer hours and higher costs, which drives prices for our services up and shrinks our market size.</p>
					<p>Spinattic is a solution that makes it possible to create quality, robust 360 based virtual tours, with interfaces that can be customized easily by the photographer. Most photographers are not programmers, and if you happen to be a talented photographer and programmer then you are most likely lacking in the area of design. Or maybe you are a photographer with a knack for design, but not programming. This is where Spinattic comes in. Spinattic recognizes that there are many great cameras, techniques with various quality levels and concepts that photographers can choose from to create their images. Your photographic work is your masterpiece, it should be paired with good design and a flexible customizable interface that matches the quality of your imagery.</p>
