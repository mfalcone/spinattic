		</ul>
	</li>	
	<li>Termination of Services
		<ul>
		<li>You may request termination of a Subscription at any time. When Spinattic receives your termination request, Spinattic will terminate your Subscription. Spinattic will notify you of termination via email. A Subscription is not terminated in this manner until you receive confirmation of termination from Spinattic. Additionally, Spinattic may terminate a Subscription, or any user's access to and use of the Site or the Paid Account Service, at any time at its sole discretion, which termination shall be effective immediately.</li>
		<li>All Subscription Fees are nonrefundable, and upon termination, cancellation or discontinuation of a Subscription for any reason, you will not receive a refund for any Subscription Fees or other amounts previously charged to you, or for any unused portion of any Subscription.</li>

		<li>You may change your email or credit card information by accessing your profile in Spinattic.  If the credit card account designated on your account is invalid and cannot be billed for the renewal Subscription Fee, then Spinattic may terminate your Subscription for nonpayment.

		</ul>

		<ul>
			<li>Spinattic offers holders of Advanced and higher accounts the possibility to download copies of their original uploaded equirectangular panoramic photo images on request.
